# mos2_defect_detection

The purpose of this project is to automatically identify the defects on the MoS2 images. The images were generated by the atomic force microscope (AFM).  
Defects on MoS2 inclue clusters, impurities and holes. By applying deep learning on the images, different types of defects can be segmented and classified.

## Dataset
- Training datasets: 70 images
- Testing datasets: 20 images

## Experimental Result
- Red area: impurity  
- Green area: hole  
- Blue: cluster
